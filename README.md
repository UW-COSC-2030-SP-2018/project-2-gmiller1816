Not sure if this was allowed, but in order to allow the functions to process different data types I simply overloaded them. All functions should work with either vectors or arrays (basic arrays, not arrays from the array class). The Bloom Filter and Hash Function work with strings or ints. I think I sacrificed functionality for time, and things could be a bit more streamlined, but it works in the way it's supposed to.
